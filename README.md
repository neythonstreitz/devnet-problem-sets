# Neython's DevNet Problem Sets

## About
The following example scenarios are meant to help practice for Cisco's DevNet Associate 200-901.
Please note that these are NOT official practice questions and are only meant to supplement studying for the exam.
Any and all recommendations/feedback is welcome!

## How to Use:
Feel free to use the practice problems in whatever way you feel helps.
However, the questions are designed as specific "customer scenarios" where you're tasked with using your network automation/progammability skills to help a fictional client.


Included in each Scenario are multiple choice, drag and drop, and free response questions.
While the DevNet Associates exam does not have free response, these questions are meant to push you to think about how you would explain concepts to other people!
That is, its one thing to know something, but its another thing to be able to teach it to someone!

Answers to the questions can be found in the Solutions folder.
Please note that the free response answers are only example responses and more than one answer can be right!
